# thesoda.io (New 2024)

### The Software Developers Association

This is the directory for SoDA's new ReactJS website.

## How to run website locally

The website uses npm, which manages all dependencies and has a dummy server that you can run on your local machine to view the website.

```shell
> cd asu-soda-newsite
> npm i #install all dependencies if this is the first time you are doing this
> npm ci (optional)
> npm run dev
```

The server will refresh the page automatically when you make changes to the code!

## Making changes

Always make sure you pull before working on the repository. Since the website is a latest NEXT application, uses many dependencies, and is written in ES6, you will have to use many tools to transpile the code.

**_The use of Github Desktop is recommended._**
